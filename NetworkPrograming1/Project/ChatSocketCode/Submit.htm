           This 
is a simple chat program using asynchronous socket. This program is 
act like&nbsp;client/server, it can</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>connect to other PC&nbsp;&nbsp; (install with 
same program) or&nbsp;wait for other PC to connect.&nbsp;You can test the 
program on the same PC by running the program twice.&nbsp;Each one listen 
to&nbsp;an&nbsp;port (e.g. first is listen to 998 and the second to 
999).&nbsp;Click the listen button of both&nbsp;program, key in the 
hostname/Host IP Address as&nbsp;"local" or "127.0.0.1" and Port no as 999 
at&nbsp;first program (cause we want to connect to the second program which 
listen to port 999),&nbsp;click connect. The IP address will list at the&nbsp; 
list &nbsp;of the 2 program (if successfully connected). At this&nbsp;point, u 
can start sending messages.&nbsp;</FONT>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the simple program also, i also 
demonstrated how the event is raised during connection, disconnection, sending 
and receiving (like the OnConnect, OnSend... in MSVC++ MFC's socket 
class).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestion, amendment or comment 
is welcome, cause i still new in C#.&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;<!-- create more blocks of article text as needed separated --><!-- with the <p> HTML tag --><!-- start a block of source code --></DIV>
